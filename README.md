# 2048_Apollo

This is a port of the popular mobile game 2048 for the Apollo Guidance Computer.

The game is written in AGC assembly, just like the Command Module and Lunar Lander software from the Apollo missions.

Fortunately, unlike the pioneering programmers of that software, I didn't have to enter my code onto punch cards and then wait two months for it to be hand-woven into core rope memory. The joys of modern technology means it assembles in milliseconds and can then be tested in a Linux-based emulator, VirtualAGC. 

I have commented each line of code to show what it does, for anyone who has written 8-bit or 16-bit assembly it should be fairly easy to follow. Being such an early computer, the AGC has a reputation of being difficult to program, but coming from C64 and Channel F development it didn't seem all that different - but then I'm making 2048, not calculating the required thrust to achieve lunar orbit.....
